<b>这篇 blog 的<a href="/tags/travel/Alaska-Tour-Plan" class="custom-link-3">中文版本</a>。</b>

# <span style="color: #8E403A;">Foreword</span>

Alaska is located outside the contiguous United States, bordered by Canada to the east and separated from Russia by the Bering Strait to the west, with the Arctic Ocean to the north and the Pacific Ocean to the south. Alaska is the largest state in the U.S., with an area greater than the combined size of the next five largest states in the mainland. It is home to breathtaking natural landscapes such as snow-capped mountains, glaciers, lakes, rivers, and forests, along with an abundance of wildlife resources. This blog was originally prepared as a travel guide for the Alaska trip with V1ncent, Steven, Tina, and Chenghong from March 24 to April 2, 2025, covering the state’s major attractions and itinerary planning. The 10-day, 9-night journey was filled with the magnificent scenery of the far north, along with challenges, thrills, and the serenity of the return. In fond remembrance.

### &#9642; <span style="color: #71D7FF;">Earthquake Park</span>

Earthquake Park is located north of Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, at the southwest corner of the city of Anchorage. The park is dedicated to commemorating the Great Alaska Earthquake that occurred on March 27, 1964 (also known as Good Friday Earthquake, as it happened to fall on Good Friday). The earthquake had a magnitude of 8.5 and a moment magnitude of 9.2, making it the strongest earthquake ever recorded in North America and the second strongest earthquake globally since the advent of systematic seismic measurement methods in 1900. The earthquake triggered a tsunami, resulting in a total of 139 deaths and $300 million in damages in the Alaska region. The park contains existing geological features from the earthquake.

### &#9642; <span style="color: #71D7FF;">Kenai Fjords National Park</span>

At the meeting point of mountains, glaciers, and the ocean lies Kenai Fjords National Park, located in Seward, about 200 kilometers south of Anchorage. Kenai Fjords National Park is one of the most popular national parks in Alaska and the only one in the U.S. National Park System themed around glaciers. The park is home to numerous glaciers, marine life, and bird species.

</figcaption>
</div>

Boarding a cruise from Seward Harbor, we sailed along Resurrection Bay toward the waters where the southern part of Kenai Fjords National Park meets the North Pacific. The surface of Resurrection Bay, unlike the open ocean, is unusually calm and austere, creating a striking contrast with the marine animals that accompany the journey. The pristine forests lining both shores are part of the national park, yet in winter’s icy grip, they temporarily lose their vitality, leaving only the dark depths of the woods and the snow-capped peaks. According to the guide, in summer the scenery transforms completely, with the possibility of spotting mountain goats clinging to the cliffs.

There are two boat tour companies in Kenai Fjords National Park - <a href="https://www.alaskacollection.com/day-tours/kenai-fjords-tours/" class="custom-link-1">Kenai Fjords Tours</a> and <a href="https://majormarine.com/" class="custom-link-1">Major Marine Tours</a>. Given the timing of our trip to Alaska, at that time both companies only had one route available: <a href="https://www.alaskacollection.com/day-tours/kenai-fjords-tours/spring-resurrection-bay-tour/" class="custom-link-1">Spring Resurrection Bay Tour</a> and <a href="https://majormarine.com/tour/spring-wildlife-cruise/" class="custom-link-1">Spring Wildlife Cruise</a>.

<b>Departure Time</b>: 12:00 PM.

<b>Ticket Price</b>: Approximately $100 (Spring Resurrection Bay Tour); Approximately $115 (Spring Wildlife Cruise)<br>

<b>Duration</b>: 4 hours.

### &#9642; <span style="color: #71D7FF;">Dalton Highway</span>

The road of the brave to the Arctic! The Dalton Highway stretches 666 kilometers from Fairbanks to Deadhorse, next to the Arctic Ocean. Built in 1974 for the construction of the Alaska oil pipeline, most of the road is unpaved and is one of the most remote and treacherous roads in the United States. The Dalton Highway offers stunning scenery, crossing the Arctic Circle, the Alaska Range, and the Arctic tundra, and passes through another national park in Alaska: Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve. The famous Arctic Circle sign is located at 65°52′50″N, 185 kilometers along the Dalton Highway (near Coldfoot).

</div>

Although Alaska has countless breathtaking landscapes, the scenery along the Dalton Highway left the deepest impression on me. Departing from Fairbanks, the urban landscape was quickly left behind, replaced by vast, mysterious white plains, rolling hills, unreachable snow-capped mountains in the distance, and a lonely road stretching into the unknown. For hundreds of kilometers, the route was almost entirely uninhabited, with no houses or even cell signal, only the occasional truck and swirling dust reminding us of human existence. The sights along the Dalton Highway may not be as spectacular as many other attractions in Alaska, but the eternal tranquility and solitude are even more moving.

</div>

After crossing the Yukon River, the Dalton Highway welcomes its only supply station in the first half: the Yukon River Supply Station. Here, you can replenish food and fuel (due to the distance from the city, the fuel price here is twice that of Fairbanks), and you can also send a postcard from the Yukon River.

When we reached the Arctic Circle sign, it was already 7:30 PM, and the sky was getting darker, but it recorded the moment when a group of people first entered the Arctic Circle.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="/assets/images/Travel/Alaska Tour Plan/IMG_3221.JPG.jpeg">

  <figcaption style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1.3em;">The Arctic Circle sign, a symbol of bravery!</figcaption>
</div>

When we returned from the Arctic Circle sign, it was already 8:30 PM. The return journey was anything but straightforward. As night gradually fell, the temperature outside the car dropped below zero, and all the sights of the day were slowly swallowed by darkness. The fuel gauge showed only half a tank remaining. To make matters worse, shortly after leaving the Arctic Circle sign, the vehicle emitted a tire pressure warning: the pressure in the right rear tire was slowly decreasing. This was like a bolt from the blue—the Yukon River Supply Station had already closed, and Fairbanks was nearly 400 kilometers away. If the tire were to lose all its pressure, we would be unable to safely navigate the icy mountain roads and would have to wait for rescue in the desolate wilderness.

Fortunately, things did not get worse. The rate of tire pressure loss was not as fast as we had imagined, and a rough estimate told us that there was still some room for maneuver. Under the starry sky, two faint headlights slowly moved forward in the darkness. Nature is great and awe-inspiring, the vast night marks 14 hours of isolation from the world. In a daze, it seemed that we really merged into this darkness, wandering in the boundless universe and starlight.

It was 3:30 AM when we returned to our accommodation in Fairbanks. After 14 hours of trekking, this self-driving journey along the Dalton Highway finally came to an end.

<b>Estimated driving time (whole journey)</b>: 11 hours (the final actual duration was 14 hours).

<div class="warning_span" style="margin-top:0;">
  1, Most sections of the Dalton Highway are unpaved and in poor condition. Therefore, most car rental companies in Alaska do not allow renters to drive on the Dalton Highway. If you need to drive, you must find a suitable local rental company in Fairbanks, such as <a href="https://www.alaska4x4rentals.com/" class="custom-link-1">Alaska 4X4 Rentals</a>, <a href="https://www.alaskaoverlander.com/" class="custom-link-1">Alaska Overlander</a>, <a href="https://alaskaautorental.com/" class="custom-link-1">Alaska Auto Rental</a>; <br>
  2, Most areas along the Dalton Highway are signal-free wilderness, so it is recommended to prepare offline maps in advance; <br>
  3, Some sections of the Dalton Highway are mountainous, and the road surface may be icy in winter. Please drive carefully and do not exceed the speed limit in mountainous areas. Drivers should have relatively rich driving experience; <br>
  4, Please be careful of the sand and gravel kicked up when meeting large trucks, as they may shatter the windshield; <br>
  5, The unpaved sections of the Dalton Highway have many potholes and potential sharp stones, which can easily damage car tires at high speeds. If possible, please prepare a spare tire in advance and learn how to change a tire; <br>
  6, Please carry emergency supplies, including sufficient food, water, warm clothing, blankets, etc. If possible, a satellite phone is a very useful communication tool.

## Western/Eastern Loop

### &#9642; <span style="color: #71D7FF;">Matanuska Glacier</span>

Matanuska Glacier is located on the Eastern Loop (Glenn Highway) connecting Anchorage and Fairbanks, about 160 kilometers northeast of Anchorage. It is one of the largest glaciers in Alaska and the largest accessible by car in the world. The Matanuska River originates from the meltwater of Matanuska Glacier.
