Hello, this is Yikun, welcome to my website! I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at <a href="https://statistics.northwestern.edu/" class="custom-link-3">the Department of Statistics and Data Science</a>, <a href="https://www.northwestern.edu/" class="custom-link-3">Northwestern University</a>. I am very fortunately supervised by <a href="https://mateyneykov.com/" class="custom-link-3">Prof. Matey Neykov</a>. My research interests include hypothesis testing, minimax theory, optimization method in statistics, and machine learning theory. You can find more about my recent research <a href="/research-tags/" class="custom-link-3">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Prior to joining Northwestern, I received my B.S. degree in Statistics in 2023 from <a href="https://www.stat.pku.edu.cn/" class="custom-link-3">the Department of Probability and Statistics</a>, <a href="https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/" class="custom-link-3">School of Mathematical Sciences</a>, <a href="https://www.pku.edu.cn/" class="custom-link-3">Peking University</a>, where I spent four wonderful years. During my undergraduate studies, I was very fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/linw/" class="custom-link-3">Prof. Wei Lin</a>.
</p>

<p>
In additional to my study and research, I have various interests. In my spare time, I enjoy traveling around (see my <a href="/personal-tags/" class="custom-link-3">personal blogs</a>!), playing badminton and reading books. Additionally, I am an amateur <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)" class="custom-link-3">Go</a> player with three Dan certification. I am also a fan of Minecraft and Counter-Strike 2. Feel free to chat with me about these topics if you are interested!
