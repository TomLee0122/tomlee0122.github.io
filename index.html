Hello, this is Yikun, welcome to my website! I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate in statistics and data science at <a href="https://statistics.northwestern.edu/" class="custom-link-3">the Department of Statistics and Data Science</a>, <a href="https://www.northwestern.edu/" class="custom-link-3">Northwestern University</a>. I am very fortunately supervised by <a href="https://mateyneykov.com/" class="custom-link-3">Prof. Matey Neykov</a>. Currently, we are working on the minimax bound for robust mean testing problem under the Gaussian sequence model.

Prior to joining Northwestern, I received my B.S. in Statistics from <a href="https://www.stat.pku.edu.cn/" class="custom-link-3">the Department of Probability and Statistics</a>, <a href="https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/" class="custom-link-3">School of Mathematical Sciences</a>, <a href="https://www.pku.edu.cn/" class="custom-link-3">Peking University</a>, where I spent four wonderful years. I was also very fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/linw/" class="custom-link-3">Prof. Wei Lin</a>.
</p>

<p>
In additional to my study and research, I have various interests. In my spare time, I enjoy playing badminton and reading books. Additionally, I am an amateur Go player with three Dan certification. I am also a fan of Minecraft and Counter-Strike 2. Feel free to chat with me about these topics if you are interested!
